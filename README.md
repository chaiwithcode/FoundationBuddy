# Foundation Buddy — Apple Intelligence Assistant

**Foundation Buddy** is a SwiftUI app for iOS 26+ that uses Apple’s Foundation Models Framework to run AI fully on-device, with Liquid Glass UI and streaming or structured response modes. This project serves as a practical example of how Foundation Models can be explored and integrated into native Apple apps.
